 DSE-Kimbrough-Stabilizer/examples/simulation_walkthrough.md🧪 Simulation Walkthrough: Verifying Deterministic StabilityThis document provides a walkthrough of the core simulation used to validate the Kimbrough-Banach Harmonic Fixed-Point Theorem and the efficiency of the DSE-Kimbrough-Stabilizer architecture.I. Simulation Goal: Proof of ConceptThe goal of the simulation is to verify the deterministic convergence dictated by the Kimbrough Contraction Principle and calculate the expected efficiency gain, known as the Optimal Sequential Count, which serves as an early proxy for the Quantum Fidelity Stability Index (QFSI).II. The Core Harmonic Choice ModelThe simulation models a statistical process (reflecting a choice made by the quantum system) where the bias factor is derived from the Kimbrough Invariant Law ($\Phi$).The constant used is the Golden Ratio ($\Phi \approx 1.618034$). The probability of a "successful" stable choice ($P(0)$) is intrinsically linked to the fixed point $x^*$:$$P(0) = \frac{\Phi}{\Phi + 1} \approx 0.618034$$A. The Optimal Sequential CountThe core test, run_secure_test, calculates the joint probability of two independent control decisions both resulting in a successful stable state (Choice 0). This metric, the Optimal Sequential Count (OSC), is defined as the number of trials where both choices resulted in 0.Theoretical Probability of Joint Success:$$P_{OSC} = (P(0))^2 = \left(\frac{\Phi}{\Phi + 1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\Phi}\right)^2 \approx 0.381966$$III. Efficiency BenchmarkingThe simulation demonstrates a significant gain over a purely random system:
