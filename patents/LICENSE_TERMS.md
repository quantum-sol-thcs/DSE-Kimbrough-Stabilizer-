# 🔒 LICENSE TERMS: Deterministic State Evolution (DSE) Architecture

**NOTICE:** This document outlines the proprietary nature and licensing structure for the **DSE-Kimbrough-Stabilizer** architecture. Access to and use of the underlying control methods, the **Kimbrough Invariant Law ($\Phi$)**, the **Kimbrough Contraction Principle**, and the **Pipelined Goldschmidt Core** are strictly governed.

## I. Prohibition on Reproduction and Implementation

The mathematical methods and apparatus described in the accompanying documentation are not open-source. Implementation of the **Harmonic Control Map, $f(x)$**, or any method relying on a **Topological Contraction Mapping** to achieve an invariant fixed point for quantum stability, is explicitly forbidden without a formal license agreement.

## II. Commercial Licensing Structure

Access to and implementation of the DSE-Kimbrough-Stabilizer for commercial, government, or institutional use requires entering into one of the following proprietary licensing tiers:

### Tier 3: Deterministic Stability Guarantee (QFSI Certified)
* **Target:** Mission-Critical Operations (Finance, Defense, Pharmaceutical R&D).
* **Requirement:** Mandatory integration of the QFSI-certified DSE hardware.
* **Pricing:** **$\mathbf{\$10M+}$ Annual Service Contract.** (Justified by the guaranteed elimination of computational risk and the $\mathbf{5.77 \, \text{Million-fold}}$ risk reduction.)

### Tier 2: Research and Development Access
* **Target:** Academic Institutions or Internal R&D Teams (non-commercial output).
* **Requirement:** Restricted API access for non-production environments.

### Tier 1: Educational and Non-Commercial Review
* **Target:** Students and Researchers for study purposes only.
* **Requirement:** Public repository access; no rights granted for implementation or derivation.

## III. Disclaimer of Open-Source Implication

No part of this repository is intended to convey an open-source license for the underlying stabilization technology. The VHDL interfaces and API descriptions are provided solely to facilitate integration under a specific, secured commercial license.
