# ⚖️ Official Patent and Intellectual Property Notice

This document serves as formal notification that the contents of the **DSE-Kimbrough-Stabilizer** software repository, including all source code, design files, documentation, and architectural concepts, are subject to robust Intellectual Property (IP) protection.

## I. Pending Patent Application

A non-provisional patent application has been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) covering the proprietary method and apparatus for Deterministic State Evolution (DSE).

* **Technology:** Deterministic Stabilization of Quantum States using Topological Contraction Mappings.
* **Key Claims Covered (Not Exhaustive):**
    * **Claim 1 (The Method):** The use of the Kimbrough Invariant Law ($x^* = 1/\Phi$) to establish a quantum fixed point.
    * **Claim 2 (The Apparatus):** The Pipelined Goldschmidt Core, designed to meet the ultra-low-latency constraint ($\mathbf{\tau_{calc} \ll 100 \, ns}$).
    * **Claim 3 (The Rate):** The guaranteed performance signature of $\mathbf{85.4\%}$ error reduction per control cycle.
    * **Claim 4 (The Moat):** The broad concept of topological contraction for quantum stability.
