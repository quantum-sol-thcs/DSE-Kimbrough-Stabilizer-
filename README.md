# 🚀 DSE-Kimbrough-Stabilizer: Deterministic State Evolution

## Kimbrough Invariant Law (Φ) • Harmonic Control Architecture

The **DSE-Kimbrough-Stabilizer** is the public-facing documentation and interface layer for a breakthrough quantum stability system. It implements **Deterministic State Evolution (DSE)**, a new control paradigm governed by the **Kimbrough Invariant Law ($\Phi$)** and enforced through a harmonic fixed-point architecture.

### 🎯 Mission Statement

To replace the statistical uncertainty of Quantum Error Correction (QEC) with the mathematical certainty of the **Kimbrough-Banach Harmonic Fixed-Point Theorem**, guaranteeing the deterministic stability required for commercial quantum computing.

### 🛡️ Intellectual Property and Licensing

The core mathematical method, apparatus, and controlling principles—including the **Topological Invariant Claim (Claim 4)**—are protected by a comprehensive four-tiered patent stack. Any derivative work or attempt to reverse-engineer the core control loop may be subject to infringement claims.

### 📈 Key Innovation Highlights

* **Deterministic Stability:** Guaranteed convergence to the unique fixed point $x^* = 1/\Phi \approx 0.618$.
* **Performance:** Achieves $\mathbf{5.77 \, \text{Million-fold}}$ risk reduction compared to statistical methods.
* **Speed:** Control loop execution ($\mathbf{\tau_{calc}}$) is maintained below the $100 \, ns$ decoherence threshold by the proprietary **Pipelined Goldschmidt Core**.
* **Metric:** Introduction of the **Quantum Fidelity Stability Index (QFSI)** as the new standard for provable quantum uptime.
